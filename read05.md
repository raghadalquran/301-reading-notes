# SUMMARY ##

## Node.js ##
- Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. 
- It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform.
- To be sure it's a web server and not just a piece of code that returns a single line of text, we'll use it as a server! You can check it with your smartphone.
- Node allows you to use the so-called event loop, which works faster because of non-blocking behavior. For example, nginx uses an event loop with asynchronous I/O. That's why it's fast as hell!
- Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). 
- It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer.
