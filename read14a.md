# SUMMARY #

## Database Normalization ##
- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  
- The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

**General normalization objectives include:**

- Minimize the need for restructuring a database when new data types are introduced.
- Make relations free from unwanted deletions, updates and insertions.

**There are three main reasons to normalize a database.** 
- The first is to minimize duplicate data.
- The second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues.
- The third is to simplify queries. 

**Normal Forms**

- When rules of functional dependencies are applied to relations, these relations are then transformed into a state that is known as Normal Form. Normalization checks that different kinds of inconsistencies are not introduced in the database. Different kinds of normal forms that are used in relational database management system (RDBMS) are:

1.First Normal form(1NF)
1.Second Normal form(2NF)
1.Third Normal form(3NF)
1.Boyce/Codd Normal form(BCNF)
