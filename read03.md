# SUMMARY #

## Javascript templating ##
- **Javascript templating** is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. 
- The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
- The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.
- Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything.
- It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
- It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. 
- Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
- Mustache is a specification for a templating language. In general, we would write templates according to the Mustache specification, and it can then be compiled by a templating engine to be rendered to create an output.
