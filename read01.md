## All About Floats & CSS Floats Explained By Riding An Escalator ##

- Float is a CSS positioning property.
- Floats create alternate flows.
- In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed.
- Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
- Float's sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. 
- There is one more wrinkle that we have not discussed yet: the clear property. “Clear” allows elements to specify where they should align in comparison to the floated elements.

## Don’t Overthink It Grids ##

- The vast majority of websites out there use a grid. They may not explicitly have a grid system in place, but if they have a "main content area" floated to the left a "sidebar" floated to the right, it's a simple grid.

- Columns
- Clearing Context
- Gutters
- Outside Gutters

## SMACSS ##

“SMACSS is becoming one of the most useful contributions to front-end discussions in years” *
- SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework. 
- SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process.
- It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS. 

## Responsive Web Design ##

-Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.
- Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. 
- Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.
- Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example.
