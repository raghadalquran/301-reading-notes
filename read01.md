# SUMMARY #

## All About Floats ##
- Float is a CSS positioning property.
- Floats create alternate flows.
- In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed.
- Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
- Float's sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. 

## Don’t Overthink It Grids ##
- The vast majority of websites out there use a grid. They may not explicitly have a grid system in place, but if they have a "main content area" floated to the left a "sidebar" floated to the right, it's a simple grid.

- Outside Gutters

## SMACSS ##
“SMACSS is becoming one of the most useful contributions to front-end discussions in years” *
- SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework. 
- SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process.
- It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS.
