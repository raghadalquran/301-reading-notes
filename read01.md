# SUMMARY #

## All About Floats ##
- Float is a CSS positioning property.
- Floats create alternate flows.
- In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed.
- Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
- Float's sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.
