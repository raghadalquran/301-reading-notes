- jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed. 
- jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 
- jQuery even adds some extra CSS-style selectors which offer additional functionality. 
- jQuery has methods that offer web developers simpler ways to perform common tasks.

## Pair Programming ##
- pair programming commonly involves two roles: 
**the Driver** and **the Navigator.** 
- *The Driver* is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
- *The Navigator* thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
