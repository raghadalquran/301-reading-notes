# SUMMARY #
## SQL : Structured Query Language ##
- SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
- There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. 
- A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.
