# SUMMARY #

## What Is Node.js? ##
- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. 
- Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- It is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.
- The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers.

### Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript ###
- Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.
- if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm (or maybe Yarn). 
- The biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server.
