# SUMMARY #

Silicon Valley’s gender gap.

- In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.
Marketing games.
- the Apple personal computer that was released at the time was marketed specifically to boys (included them teasing girls’ computer skills), as were a whole range of other consoles. This gave rise to male computing culture. As a result, a 1985 study reported that 73% of men used a computer on a weekly basis, compared to 45% of women surveyed.

**Why are tech companies trying to hire for diversity?**
- Tech companies are starting to realize that hiring women and underrepresented minorities have benefits that reach beyond a socially-appropriate PR effort. By doing so, companies can increase revenue, improve retention rates, and boost productivity from both tenured and* new employees*(Diverse companies perform better and It’s the right thing to do )
