# SUMMARY #

## CSS Grid ##
- CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS.
- It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. 
- Grid gives us control over how wide or narrow each of the ‘grid cells’ get. This allows us to maintain a sensible aspect ratio to their height. 

## Regex Summary ##
- Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).
- A regex usually comes within this form /abc/, where the search pattern is delimited by two slash characters /. At the end we can specify a flag with these values (we can also combine them each other):
- g (global) does not return after the first match, restarting the subsequent searches from the end of the previous match.
- m (multi-line) when enabled ^ and $ will match the start and end of a line, instead of the whole string.
- i (insensitive) makes the whole expression case-insensitive (for instance /aBc/i would match AbC).
